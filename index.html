<h1>We Are Still Coding Here.</h1>
<p id="paragraph1">Hey, what's up.</p>
<p id="paragraph2">If you're wondering who I am, I am the real one of WASCH or We are Still Coding Here.
    I'm a pretty cool guy who likes to code and make some stuff for people to enjoy. Also still a newbie here at coding so you have to bear with me.
    If you want to check out some of the stuff that I have coded, head over to the right side of this website.
    There, you can find projects that I have worked on or have contributed to. You should also check out the people who I have worked with, pretty talented people too.
</p>
<p>I like to consider myself as a chill guy who likes to game in his free time and likes to observe the layout of a game and how it works.</p>
